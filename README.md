   A SaaS for financial management uses AppSignal to track subscription upgrades or new trial signups and sends the team a real-time Discord alert.

2. **E-Learning Platforms**:

   An online course provider monitors when a student completes a course and triggers an event to Discord for marketing follow-ups.

3. **E-commerce Platforms**:

   An e-commerce company uses AppSignal to track new orders for timely processing and receives alerts when stock for products is low to prompt reordering.

4. **Open Source Projects**:

   An open-source library team tracks their package downloads on platforms like npm or PyPI and uses AppSignal for updates.

5. **DevOps Teams**:

   A cloud infrastructure provider uses the platform to notify their team of infrastructure anomalies, such as exceeding predefined CPU or storage limits.

6. **Online Forum**:

An online forum uses AppSignal to monitor new posts and get notifications when a post goes viral.
